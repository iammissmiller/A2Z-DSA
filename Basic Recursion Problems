# Basic Recursion Problems

These are common beginner-level recursion problems used to understand **function calls, base conditions, and backtracking**.

---

## 1. Print Name 5 Times

Print a given name exactly 5 times using recursion.

### Logic

* Print name
* Call function again
* Stop when count reaches 5

---

## 2. Print Linearly from 1 to N

Print numbers from **1 to N** in increasing order using recursion.

### Idea

* Print current number
* Call function for next number

---

## 3. Print from N to 1

Print numbers from **N to 1** using recursion.

### Idea

* Print current number
* Call function for previous number

---

## 4. Print Linearly from 1 to N (Using Backtracking)

Numbers are printed **after** recursive calls return.

### Idea

* First make recursive call
* Print number while returning

This demonstrates **backtracking**.

---

## 5. Print from N to 1 (Using Backtracking)

Reverse printing using backtracking.

### Idea

* Recursive calls go till base condition
* Printing happens while returning
