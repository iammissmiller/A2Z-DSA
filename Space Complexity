# Space Complexity

## What is it???

* It is not measured in terms of bytes or stuff.
* It is also said in terms of Big-Oh Notation.
*  Space Complexity        =         Auxiliary Space                    +                      Input Space  
                        (space that you take to store the problem)               (space that you tale to store the input)
