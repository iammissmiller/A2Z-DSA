## Containers 

STL containers are generic data structures (like arrays, lists, sets, maps) that store and organize elements in memory, providing fast and easy operations such as 
insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Pairs

A pair in C++ is a simple STL container that stores two values (possibly of different types) as a single unit.

## Vectors

## for each loop

## List

## Dequeue

## set

## multiset

## unordered set

## Map

## Multimap

## Unordered Map

## Sorting
