# Collision

Collision occurs when:

### Two or more keys are mapped to the same hash index

Definition:

When multiple keys want to go to the same hash location, a collision occurs.

Example:

ℎ(𝑘) = ℎ(𝑘2) 

## Effect of Collision

### Searching, insertion, or deletion may take more time

### In the worst case, all keys may go to the same index

Worst Case Time Complexity:

O(n)

(When all keys collide and are stored at one index)

## Key Points (Exam Friendly)

### Division method is simple and fast

### Choice of m is important (preferably a prime number)

### Collision handling techniques are required (chaining, probing, etc.)

### Without proper collision handling, performance degrades to O(n)
